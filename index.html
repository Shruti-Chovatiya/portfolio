                    <h3>Information about project</h3>
                    <p class="info-para">For this project, I designed and developed a sophisticated front-end hotel
                        website inspired by a
                        W3Schools template, showcasing my ability to create dynamic and user-centric web solutions. The
                        website provides an extensive overview of the hotel’s offerings, including detailed descriptions
                        and images of various room types such as single, double, and luxury rooms.</p>
                    <p class="info-para">To enhance user
                        experience, I implemented an intuitive registration form that allows potential guests to easily
                        book their stay. The site supports multiple payment methods, ensuring a seamless transaction
                        process. </p>
                    <p class="info-para">Additionally, I included comprehensive information about the hotel’s sister
                        properties
                        located across different parts of the world, giving users insight into the broader network of
                        hotels. The website also features a dedicated contact section with up-to-date contact details
                        and integrates social media handles for better engagement and connectivity with visitors.</p>
                    <p class="info-para"> This
                        project not only demonstrates my proficiency in front-end development but also highlights my
                        ability to create aesthetically pleasing and functional web interfaces that cater to both user
                        needs and business objectives.</p>

                    <h3>Vegan Store Template</h3>
                    <p class="info-para">
                        I designed a comprehensive vegan store template that highlights the quality and nutritional
                        benefits of various vegetables. </p>
                    <p class="info-para">This template is crafted using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap to
                        ensure a modern, responsive design. The website features detailed information about the
                        nutritional value of the vegetables offered, emphasizing their health benefits and superior
                        quality.</p>
                    <p class="info-para">It includes a contact section for service inquiries and provides clear
                        information
                        about the vegan store's locations, including addresses for their shops in London and Berlin.</p>
                    <p class="info-para"> The
                        design effectively combines aesthetic appeal with functionality, offering an engaging user
                        experience while showcasing the store’s commitment to high-quality, nutritious products.</p>

                    <h3>Information about project</h3>
                    <p class="info-para">I developed a versatile analytics template designed to enhance web development
                        skills.
                    </p>
                    <p class="info-para">The template features a fixed sidebar for easy navigation and incorporates
                        various types
                        of content and icons, allowing for comprehensive practice in front-end design. Utilizing
                        Bootstrap's grid system, the layout ensures responsiveness and visual impact across different
                        devices. </p>
                    <p class="info-para">This project serves as a practical tool for experimenting with new font styles,
                        content
                        organization, and layout techniques, providing a solid foundation for building dynamic,
                        user-friendly web interfaces.</p>
                    <p class="info-para"> The integration of Bootstrap also showcases my ability to
                        implement modern design frameworks effectively.
